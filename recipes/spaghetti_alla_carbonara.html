    </ol>

    <p><strong>Chef&apos;s tips:</strong>
      Ask somebody to hold the pot so you can stir pasta quickly while pouring
      the egg mixture over it. Please note the addition of reserved pasta water
      when using the magazine version of this recipe.

    <p>
      Carbonara is made with guanciale (cured pork), eggs, Pecorino Romano
      cheese, spaghetti pasta, and lots of black pepper. Italians don't add
      extra ingredients like cream, milk, garlic, or onions. Try this recipe if
      you want to make an authentic, creamy carbonara that comes straight from
      Italy, where I live. Buon appetito!
